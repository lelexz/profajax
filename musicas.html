       <p> <h2>Young and Beautiful - Lana Del Rey</h2>
        I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now <br>
        Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now <br>
        Hot summer nights, mid-July <br>
        When you and I were forever wild <br>
        The crazy days, city lights <br>
        The way you'd play with me like a child <br>
        <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        <br>
        I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now <br>
        Channeling angels in the new age now <br>
        Hot summer days, rock and roll <br>
        The way you'd play for me at your show <br>
        And all the ways I got to know <br>
        Your pretty face and electric soul <br>
        <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        <br>
        Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven <br>
        Please let me bring my man <br>
        When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in <br>
        Father, tell me if you can <br>
        All that grace, all that body <br>
        All that face makes me wanna party <br>
        He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds <br> 
        <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul? <br>
        I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? <br>
        Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful? <br>

            Come a little closer, then you'll see <br>
            <br>
            Ten thousand people stand alone now <br>
            And in the evening, the sun sank <br>
            Tomorrow it will rise <br>
            Time flies by <br>
            They all sang along <br>
            Time flies by <br>
            They all sang along <br>
            Time flies by <br>
            They all sang along <br>
            Time flies by, by <br>
            <br>
            Come a little closer, then you'll see <br>
            Come on, come on, come on <br>
            Come a little closer, then you'll see <br>
            Come a little closer, then you'll see <br>
            Come a little closer, then you'll see <br>

        <p> <h2>Criminal - Britney Spears</h2>
            He is a hustler, he's no good at all <br>
            He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum <br>
            He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable <br>
            He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun <br>
            I know you told me I should stay away <br>
            I know you said he's just a dog astray <br>
            He is a bad boy with a tainted heart <br>
            And even I know this ain't smart <br>
            <br>
            But mama I'm in love with a criminal <br>
            And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical <br>
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright <br>
            All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy <br>
            <br>
            He is a villain by the devil's law <br>
            He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun <br>
            That man's a snitch and unpredictable <br>
            He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none <br>
            All I know, should've let go, but no <br>
            'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart <br>
            And even I know this ain't smart <br>
            <br>
            But mama I'm in love with a criminal <br>
            And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical <br>
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright <br>
            All reason aside I just can't deny, I love that guy <br>
            <br>
            And he's got my name, <br>
            Tattooed on his arm his lucky charm <br>
            So I guess it's okay he's with me <br>
            And I hear people talk <br>
            Trying to make remarks keep us apart <br>
            But I don't even hear <br>
            I don't care <br>
            <br>
            'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal <br>
            And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical <br>
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright <br>
            All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy <br>
